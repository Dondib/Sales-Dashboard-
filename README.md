I built this dashboard from raw CSV to insights using Pandas, Dash, and Plotly.
 It lets you filter product types, view KPIs (total, average, max, min sales + unique items), and explore sales trends by category in an interactive way.
This project was a great exercise in:
 âœ… Data cleaning with Pandas
 âœ… Building KPIs dynamically
 âœ… Designing with a dark theme & custom colors
 âœ… Creating interactive charts with Plotly
Excited to keep pushing my Python + Data Visualization skills further!
 What do you think about the dashboard design? ðŸ’¡
